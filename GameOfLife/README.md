## Rules
At the start of the game:
- The grid is initialized with a symmetric configuration of live cells for both players.

### **Gameplay**:
- Players alternate turns. On each turn, the active player must:
1. Select and kill one of the opponentâ€™s cells.
2. Select an empty cell to bring to life with their own symbol.

### **Generation Evolution**:
After each turn:
- The grid evolves by one generation, following the rules of Conway's Game of Life:
- **Live Cells**:
    - Stay alive if they have 2 or 3 live neighbors.
    - Otherwise, they die (due to underpopulation or overpopulation).
- **Dead Cells**:
    - Come to life if they have exactly 3 live neighbors.
    - The cell takes the symbol of the majority of its neighbors.
    - (A tie is impossible since exactly 3 neighbors are required to bring a cell to life.)

### **Winning the Game**:
- A player is eliminated when they have no live cells remaining.
- The game ends when one or both players have no live cells left.
